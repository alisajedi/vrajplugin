Follow these steps:

(1) Go to : http://archive.eclipse.org/technology/epp/downloads/release/helios/SR2/eclipse-rcp-helios-SR2-win32-x86_64.zip
This is Helios for RCP and RAP developers.
(2) From this repository download the "com.qualityeclipse.favorites_1.0.0" plugin jar file.
(3) Put the downloaded jar file in the plugins, features and dropins folder of the downloaded eclipse.This should work for most of 
the systems.
(4) Start Eclipse using the command line with command: "eclipse.exe -clear -cp"
(5) If the menu does not appear, then close the eclipse and copy the contents of "plugins" and "features" folder (downloaded from this repository) to 
your plugins and features folder. If the prompt notifies some of the files are already in your original location then skip those files but do not replace
or merge them.
(6) Again do the step (4)
(7) This should solve the problem,if it does not then you need to make a folder following this exact path:"C:/Big_Data_Adaptor/images" and
put the two images inside this folder. There is an issue with bundling of images.
(8) Again do the step (4).
